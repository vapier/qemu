Blackfin QEMU port
------------------

There are some things we don't bother handling in the port for speed reasons.
If you want an accurate (but not as fast) simulator, then use the GNU sim as
found in the GNU toolchain (part of gdb).

Things we do not currently handle by design:

	- invalid parallel instruction combinations
		- no toolchain will output these
		- things like jumps

	- invalid register combinations
		- some insns cannot have same register be both source and dest
		- no toolchain will output these

	- transactional parallel instructions
		- on the hardware, if a load/store causes an exception, the other
		  insns do not change register states either.  in qemu, they do,
		  but since those exceptions will kill the program anyways, who
		  cares.  no intermediate store buffers!

	- AC0_COPY and V_COPY
		- no one has ever used these instead of AC0 or V

	- no support for RND_MOD

There are a few insns/modes we don't currently handle, but it's more a matter
of nothing really uses these, so we haven't bothered.  If these matter to you,
then feel free to request support for them.
